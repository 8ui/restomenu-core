// CITY MUTATIONS - City-specific GraphQL mutations
// ====================================================================

// NOTE: Based on the current GraphQL schema, cities are read-only entities.
// Cities are managed at the infrastructure level and do not have
// create/update/delete mutations available through the API.

// This file exists as a placeholder for consistency with the codebase structure
// and to provide a place for future city mutations if they become available.

// Placeholder export to make this a valid module
export const CITY_MUTATIONS = {} as const;
